            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">For two decades, the Indian IT growth story seemed unstoppable. If you were a project manager with 10 years of experience, a double-digit hike was almost guaranteed. But 2024 has painted a different picture.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">The "Frozen Middle"</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Companies like TCS, Infosys, and global captives are flattening their pyramids. The layer most at risk? The "Frozen Middle"—managers who oversee teams but haven't updated their hands-on skills in AI, Cloud, or Data Strategy.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">If you find yourself managing spreadsheets more than driving innovation, you are in the danger zone. The industry no longer pays a premium for purely administrative coordination.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Pivot: From Manager to Value Creator</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">The professionals surviving and thriving today are those who have embraced "T-shaped" skills. They have deep expertise in one domain (e.g., Supply Chain, Fintech, Healthcare) while maintaining broad leadership capabilities.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Start by auditing your relevance. When was the last time you learned a tool that didn't exist 5 years ago? If the answer is "I don't remember," it's time for an intervention.</p>

        image: "/images/mentor-pria.png",
        content: `
            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">In India, the cultural expectation to care for aging parents is deeply rooted. Combine this with the skyrocketing cost of private education for children, and you have the classic "Sandwich Generation" squeeze.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Financial Strain</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">For a professional in their 40s in Mumbai or Delhi, the outflow is relentless. EMIs for the second home, medical insurance for parents (which rises with age), and coaching classes for the kids. It often leads to a risk-averse career mindset.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">"I hate my job, but I can't afford to quit." This mantra kills more careers than incompetence ever will.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">Building an Emotional Moat</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">You cannot pour from an empty cup. Sustaining your career requires protecting your mental health. This means setting boundaries—not just at work, but at home. It means having honest financial conversations with family members.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your career longevity is your family's biggest asset. Dheya's mentorship programs often focus as much on financial alignment as they do on resume building, because the two are inseparable in the Indian context.</p>

        content: `
            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">We are seeing a silent exodus. Senior leaders, flush with ESOPs and savings, are walking away from corner offices. They aren't retiring; they are 'rewiring'.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Maslow Shift</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Once the EMI for the apartment in Gurgaon is paid off, the motivation to tolerate toxic boardroom politics evaporates. The question shifts from "How much can I earn?" to "How do I want to spend my days?"</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">Designing Your Second Innings</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">This isn't about impulsive resignation. It's about strategic design. We encourage our senior mentees to start "side experiments" while still employed. Consult for a startup. Mentor a student. Visit that organic farm on weekends.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Test the waters of your passion before you dive in. The goal is to build a "Portfolio Career"—a mix of high-income consulting and high-purpose passion projects.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">The "Gap" on a resume used to be a black hole in the Indian job market. But the narrative is changing, thanks to returnship programs and a shift in hiring maturity.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">Own Your Story</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Don't apologize for the gap. Managing a household, raising children, or caring for family builds resilience, time management, and empathy—soft skills that AI cannot replicate.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">The "Bridge" Project</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">The best way to silence doubts about your technical currency is a "Bridge Project". A freelance assignment, a certification with a capstone project, or a pro-bono consulting gig.</p>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">It gives you something current to talk about in interviews. It shifts the focus from "What have you been doing for 3 years?" to "Look what I just built last month."</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">In the West, they call it "Quiet Quitting". At Dheya, we call it BBD Syndrome—Bored, Burned out, Dissatisfied. It's the state of functioning on autopilot.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Cost of Coping</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">You might think you are coping well. You hit your targets. You smile in meetings. But internally, the battery is draining. This dissonance leads to lifestyle diseases—hypertension, anxiety, and insomnia—which are rampant in corporate India.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-4 mt-8">Re-igniting the Spark</h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">The solution isn't always a new job. Sometimes, it's about "Job Crafting"—redesigning your current role to better align with your strengths. Other times, it's about accepting that your job is just a utility provider for your real life's work outside the office.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">This is where the "Mid-Life Crisis" hits. But reframed, it is a "Mid-Life Awakening". It is the perfect time to pivot from Seeking Success to Seeking Significance.</p>
